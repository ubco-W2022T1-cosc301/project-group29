## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This data was collected from web scrapping EstesParkWeather.net weather station based in Estes Park, Colorado. The data collected encompasses averages of temperature, humidity, windspeeds, rainfall, dewpoint, and more, over a period of starting January 2009 to July 2020. The purpose of the complied dataset is unknown but the website it comes from was "created primarily as a public service for residents of Estes Park, Colorado and Vicinity. However, I speculate that because 2020 was ranked the second hottest year just after 2016, and the hottest reliably recorded temperature globally at 54.4 Celsius in Death Valley was recorded, coupled with the Atlantic hurricane season producing a record breaking 30 hurricanes , the author of the data wished to observed the year over year trends potentially where they live (NCEI/NOAA). Data from the website is collected from personal "high quality weather instruments" such as the "Davis Wireless Vantage Pro" and an Anemometer. In addition, some data complied to the original website is sourced from the National Weather Service.
