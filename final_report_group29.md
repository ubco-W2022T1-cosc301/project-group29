## **How is humidity related to temperature**
To answer this question, we used data from 2009, 2014, 2019 (increasing five by five years, total ten years). We chose too use the average temperature and humidity because it is unpossible to tell how the maximum and minimum values are related to each other. And this is the reason we are searching this question.

Firstly, let's see what the visuallized data shows us in a year. The visuallized data below shows how the average temperature and humidity goese separatly in January, April, August, and October in 2009. We picked a month from every season in the same year, to find if there will be a outstanding difference in different seasons.

As we can see in the plots, the two values goes to the opposite way. Hence, there will be high possibility that when one of the value increased, the other one decreased. However, it is too soon to conclude the answer. Therefore, we visuallized the whole data in 2009, 2014, 2019. We picked three years, five years in between each year and total ten years across to make the conclusion more reliable. Down below are the plots for these three years.

By comparing these plots, we can discovered that the linear lines of the plots always go descending. Which means when the temperature incresed, the humidity decreased.

After all, by comparing all the plots, we could find that all the plots tells us the temperature and humidity goes to the opposity direction. Hence, we can conclude that - when temperature increased, humidity decreased and vise versa.
